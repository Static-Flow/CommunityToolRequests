**NOTE: Please search for the problem you want solved first to see if a tool already exists. There are a lot of tools out there, so please try and avoid requesting the wheel be reinvented. Additionally, tool ideas like "I want something like X but does Y" is probably better suited as a feature request for X not a new tool here.**

**Have you, the best of my ability, searched online for a pre-existing tool that meeting your requirements?**


**Describe the use case for the tool you want built.**
A clear and concise description of what you want the tool to do and what problem it is solving. Consider this the design specification for what you want built. The less detailed you are, the more room for ambiguity in the final product.


**Example input data.**
If you have examples of what input this tool will be operating on that will significantly help potential developers.


**Potential runtime environments**
Where this potential tool will run can impact language or compiler decisions so please list the environment(s) this tool will be running in.
