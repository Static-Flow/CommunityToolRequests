# CommunityToolRequests
This repository attempts to provide a common place for those in the security space to request tooling and find ideas for tools to build. 

Tool requests are submitted as issues to this repository, where they are discussed, and possibly accepted by a tool developer to work on. Once the tool is complete, the developer submits a PR using the provided template. Once the requester and developer are happy, the PR is approved and a link to the finished tool is saved to this repository for easy access.

Don't forget to follow the Bot for this project: https://twitter.com/ToolRequest to see when new requests come in that you might want to work on or need yourself!


# How it works

## Requesting a tool

1. Please create an issue on this repository using the template provided.
2. Once created, patiently wait for a developer to work on your request and submit a pull request containing their tool satisfying the issue. 
3. After checking that the tool presented in the pull request satisfies your request, comment `/approved` to mark the pull request as ready to be merged.

## Taking ownership of building a tool request

1. Browse open issues to see if there is a tool request you think you could solve.
2. Comment on the issue with `/IVolunteerAsTribute` to alert the issue creator that you are attempting to build a tool to satisfy the issue.
3. Once your tool is complete, submit a pull request to this repository using the pull request template. 

Your PR should include only an edit to this Readme under the `Fullfilled Tool Requests` header like so:
<br>
`Request: [Issue #](Issue link) - [Tool Name](Link to code)`
<br>
Full Example:
<br>
Request: [3](https://github.com/Static-Flow/CommunityToolRequests/issues) - [SuperRadTool](https://github.com/Static-Flow/CommunityToolRequests)


## Submitting a tool you've already built

Do you have a tool others might want to use themselves? Feel free to combine the two pieces above and make a pull request against your own issue to share the tool with others!

1. Create an issue using the template describing what problem your tool solves
2. Create a PR referencing the issue in step 1 containing the link to your tool and close the PR.
