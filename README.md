# CommunityToolRequests
This repository attempts to provide a common place for people to request tools from me.

Tool requests are submitted as issues to this repository using the template provided. Once the tool is complete, I'll submit a PR linking to the tool. Once everyone is happy with the result, the PR is approved and a link to the finished tool is saved to this repository for easy access.

# How it works

## Requesting a tool

1. Please create an issue on this repository using the template provided.
2. Once created, patiently wait for me to take a look at it. The Issue is where we'll discuss use cases, whether I think I can build it, etc. 
3. After checking that the tool presented in the pull request satisfies your request, comment `/approved` to mark the pull request as ready to be merged.

## Taking ownership of building a tool request

1. Browse open issues to see if there is a tool request you think you could solve.
2. Comment on the issue with `/IVolunteerAsTribute` to let me know you'd like to work on it yourself.
3. Once your tool is complete, submit a pull request to this repository using the pull request template. 

Your PR should include only an edit to this Readme under the `Fullfilled Tool Requests` header like so:
<br>
`Request: [Issue #](Issue link) - [Tool Name](Link to code)`
<br>
Full Example:

Request: [3](https://github.com/Static-Flow/CommunityToolRequests/issues) - [SuperRadTool](https://github.com/Static-Flow/CommunityToolRequests)
